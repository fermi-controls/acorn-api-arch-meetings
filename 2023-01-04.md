# API Architecture R&D
##### Meeting Notes, *Jan 4th, 2023*

Finalized a version of the diagram in preparation to show outside the group. Discussed the role of DRF strings.

## Discussion

- Tabling discussion on data lakes until we're ready to do R&D.
- Reviewed "The Diagram".
  - Concerns about contents in center box
    - People will focus on what's in it
    - People will focus on what's not in it
- Big discussion of retiring DRF strings in network layer
  - DRF is a human interface and should only be used at the application level
  - Internally, requests are expressed in a type-safe manner using protobufs
  - Tony recommended the web application interface accept DRF and convert it to the GraphQL representation so any changes to DRF can be applied in one location.

## Conclusions

Will show diagram to Denise and others in ACORN. We will come up with a list of people and invite them to this meeting in two weeks.
