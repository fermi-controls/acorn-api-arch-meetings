# API Architecture R&D
##### Meeting Notes, *Dec 14th, 2022*

This week's focus was on front-end data collection.

## Discussion

- Discussed DPM's responsibility in hiding FE differences and servicing dynamic data requests.
  - Does it scale? We think so since we have a pool of them which handle the current control system load and can add more if they seem to be reaching their limit.
  - Can we ask for all the data all the time? Can DPM handle this?
  - Move to a PubSub model?
  - DPM only used for access to front-ends? Most access is through the data lake?
- Beau wants to simplify the data logger interface.
  - Devices should automatically be logged on an appropriate event.
  - Saving all is better than asking "what's useful?" We can always remove uninteresting devices.
  - Helps in diagnosing problems.
  - Provides history data for AI/ML.
  - Charlie and Tony describe a "data lake".
- Tony has heard a requirement that we need real-time access to front-end data.
  - We need to find if this is an actual requirement.
  - If so, we need to know what "real-time" means. John points out there's "hard real-time" and "soft real-time".
     - "Hard real-time" means there's a window of time in which all collection, processing and control must be completed. If the time constraint isn't met, the system fails.
     - "Soft real-time" means we can accept missing a deadline but the system mostly meets the time window. So we could, for instance, say we would like all our APIs to respond within 100ms. That way, live plots seem interactive. But we can tolerate an occasional 500ms response.

## Conclusions

Need more discussion on whether we can or should collect all device data all the time. We will also discuss how the data lake fits with DPM and the data logger service.

The "data lake" concept looks promising. It provides a sink to which front-ends can continually dump their data resulting in a consistent (i.e. timestamp/reading) resource for clients. We need R&D to see if it meets our goals.

Re: John's short discussion about hard and soft real-time systems. We could set a requirement for our APIs that there is a hard real-time limit of 5 (2?) seconds in which a reply should be sent.
