# API Architecture R&D
##### Meeting Notes, *Dec 7th, 2022*

After last week's introduction and summary of the current control system infrastructure, this week we took a simplified diagram of a future control system and discussed its merits and downsides.

## Discussion

- Remove REST from the diagram. We should define the protocols/middleware we want to use. If users want another protocol, it would be evaluated and should be budgeted.
  - Beau thinks there are tools to translate GraphQL to REST requests, so it may be a lower bar than we think.
- John described his interpretation of the diagram in supporting a phone directory app. This brought up a long discussion about the "Database Proxy" (DP).
  - Initially, DP was defined to be a task that understood all the possible APIs (using gRPC, in our diagram.) This seems like it would end up being a large, monolithic process.
  - Others thought DP was describing a layer and that it would be implemented with many, smaller services that understood the specifics of their domain and how their data is stored.
  - After Tony's further clarification of a "data lake", the group did agree that raw, SQL queries should be isolated to the DP layer.
- We added Authorization to the diagram.

## Conclusions

Beau and I specified GraphQL for the application API and gRPC for internal communications due to some experience we have with both. But those choices need to be challenged and defended. Alternatives should be considered.

It seems everyone is in agreement as to how each layer isolates technology choices from the rest of the architecture. We need further discussions about how the database proxy is implemented.
